## General Information
- This repository holds the code implementation for the auto-encoder in python and C.
- This project was implemented to compare the performance difference between the two coding languages. 
- This was created as a final project for a class in my final semester of school to learn about machine learning and performance differences in software and hardware.

## Performance Evaluation
- By comparing the different power usages and efficiency between a python implementation versus a C implementation of an auto-encoder, we are able to differ the high level software from the low level.

- While the python code is much simpler and easier to implement in order to create a auto-encoder system, the C code is much more efficient especially when it is optimized.

## Results Video
The results presented below were all run on the same machine to mitigate the hardware discrepency when it comes to testing.

## Setup
- The Python code for this project was created using Anaconda to setup the environment and Spyder as the IDE

- The C code for this project was created using Visual Studio Code as the IDE and the extension [Code Runner](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner) was used to automatically compile and run the C code to keep compile time short.

## Further Readings & Clarification
- For a better explanation on the implementation of the code, how an auto-encoder functions, and its relation to edge computing. Please refer to our paper that has been published.
